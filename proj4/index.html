    <p>
		In this project we built a simulation engine for cloths. There were various parts to this, such as setting up the physical masses and springs model of a cloth, programming the physical simulation, programming collisions with other objects and with itself, as well as programming shader programs in GLSL.
	</p>
	<p>
		Interesting parts to us was how to physically model a cloth for the purposes of physics as well as the shader program part at the end, since that allowed us to really work with things like OpenGL programming.

    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      A very high ks spring constant such as 500,000 N/m results in very "elastic" springs
      that tend to try to return to its normal length. There is minimal "bouncing" from
      the start to the resting state of the cloth. With a low ks spring constant, the
      cloth tends to "bounce" more, and takes longer to come to rest.

        What about for <code>density</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      A very low density such as 1 g/cm^2 results in a behavior similar to setting the
      spring constant to a very high value. Likewise, a very high density such as 200 g/cm^2
      results in a behavior similar to setting the spring constant to a very low value.
      This matches our expectations, since a low density makes it easier for springs
      to move the point masses, allowing the same springs to keep nearer to its
      original shape easier. Likewise, a high density makes it harder for springs to
      move the point masses, making the same springs struggle to keep its original shape.

        What about for <code>damping</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      A low damping value makes it difficult for the spring to converge to
      the stable equilibrium resting state. A high damping value makes it very
      easy for the spring to converge to the stable equilibrium resting state.
      This matches our expectations, since a low damping value means that energy
      does not dissipate as easily, whereas a high damping value means that energy
      dissipates very quickly.

      The converging rate of the damped vs undamped cloth is different.
      A fully damped cloth immediately converges, whereas the undamped cloth
      takes longer to converge. However, it still loses energy due to floating
      point errors and integration approximations.

    <p>
      The lower spring constant make the cloth wrap around the sphere more tightly,
      whereas the higher spring constant makes the cloth almost float over the sphere.
      This matches with our expectations, since a higher spring constants means
      the cloth tends to stick to its original shape better, and the lower spring
      constant means it is easier for the cloth to deform its shape.

    <p>
      The low density and high spring contants had similar behavior where the
      cloth tended to behave smoothly, like a sheet of laminated paper. This makes
      sense, since a low density or a high spring constant allows the springs to
      maintain its shape more easily, leading to flatter and less elastic behavior.
      The high density cloth crumpled more, which matches our expectations as well,
      since the higher density allows it to bend more with itself.
      Finally, the low spring constant folded more, which also matches our expectations,
      since the lower spring constant allows the cloth to deform more easily.

    <blockquote><b>
    Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      A shader program is written to run parallelized on the GPU, allowing for faster execution of parts across the graphics pipeline than would be previously possible by simply running on the CPU. This works by making them isolated programs that can thus be run in parallel, blackboxed as taking in an input and outputting something that other things can potentially use.
    </p>
	<p>
		There are two parts that make this up as we use it in this project: A <b>vertex shader</b> deals with the calculations of transformations on the vertices, such as modifying their position, and outputs a final position of the vertex as well as outputting calculated values that will be used by a fragment shader. The <b>fragment shader</b> takes these inputs and does calculations that then result in outputting a color, such as calculating and accounting for how it is affected by lighting and material situations. We combine these two parts for a shader program, linking them so that the output of the vertex shader is used as input for a fragment shader.
	</p>


    <blockquote><b>
    Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. 
    Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      The Blinn-Phong shading model works by combining three components for lighting. First is ambient light, which is just a constant color to fill in shadows. The second is diffuse light, which depends on angle of incidence from the light source upon the surface and distance, but notably does not depend on viewing angle or distance. Third is specular light, which is the "shininess" highlights that are dependent on view direction, like bright spots from the mirror reflection direction. These three are added together with this formula to get the final intensities:

    <p>
      In bump mapping, we give the illusion of texture and bumps on the object by modifying the normal vector using our TBN matrix. We can see that this works on our images, giving the checkerboard pattern that seems like it has depth to it.
    </p>
	<p>
		In displacement mapping, we take this further by additionally physically modifying the position of the vertices based on our height map. This means we can physically see some differences in positions. Within our renders, we can see that it looks like a more realistic amount of depth, and also ends up being less smooth as there are physical vertex position changes.
	</p>
	<p>
		When we change the coarseness, we notice a couple of changes in how these shaders are rendered on the sphere. Bump mapping has less noticeable differences, but we can see that the edge of the sphere becomes smoother, generally meaning that our mesh geometry is a little smoother. In displacement mapping we see a much more noticeable difference as the edges become much rougher, showing clear indentation patterns and less smooth.
